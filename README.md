# Extending the EventSource API with @microsoft/fetch-event-source

This project demonstrates how to extend the functionality of the EventSource API using the `@microsoft/fetch-event-source` library. The example includes a simple Node.js backend and a frontend application that utilize server-sent events (SSE) with POST requests, overcoming the limitations of the default EventSource API.
